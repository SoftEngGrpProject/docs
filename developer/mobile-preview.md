# Mobile Preview (via Expo CLI)

Building the application via Expo CLI involves a few key steps.

Firstly, ensure that the developer environment has been set up correctly, including the [installation of all necessary dependencies and libraries](./install-dependencies.md) using the `npm i` command.

Next, run the command `expo start` to begin the Expo development server, which will launch the application and host it in the local server.<br>
From there, the app can be previewed on a mobile device using the [**Expo app**](https://urlgeni.us/ZFGy), which can be downloaded from the iOS App Store or Google Play Store.

To preview the app, scan the QR code generated by the Expo development server using the [Expo app](https://urlgeni.us/ZFGy) on the mobile device. The app will then be built and bundled, and can be viewed and tested on the mobile device in real time.

The Expo CLI also provides a number of additional features to aid in the development and testing process, including live reloading and hot reloading, which allow for rapid iteration and testing of changes.

In addition, the Expo CLI provides tools for building and deploying the app to app stores, as well as tools for managing and publishing app updates.
